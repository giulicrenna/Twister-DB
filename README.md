## Features

- **Lightweight & Portable:** No heavy dependencies; easily moved across systems.
- **Local Storage:** Optimized for local data persistence.
- **NoSQL Approach:** Structured data management without traditional relational database overhead.
- **Simple API:** Intuitive methods for creating databases, collections, and registers.
- **Efficient:** Designed for fast data storage and retrieval.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/twister-db.git
   cd twister-db
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Tests (Optional):**
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover
   ```

## Usage

Twister DB provides a straightforward API for managing your data. Hereâ€™s a basic overview:

- **Manager:** The central class to interact with the database system.
- **Database:** Represents a database instance.
- **Collection:** Represents a collection within a database.
- **Register:** Represents an individual data entry within a collection.

## Example

Below is a simple example to get started:

```python
from twister.src.manager import Manager

# Initialize the Manager with custom database path and file name
manager = Manager(DB_PATH="data", file_name="database.tw")

# Create a new database
manager.__create_database__("my_database")

# Create a new collection in the database (set create_db=True to auto-create the database if needed)
manager.__create_collection__("my_database", "my_collection", create_db=False)

# Insert a new register (document) into the collection
data = {"name": "John Doe", "age": 30}
manager.__create_register__("my_database", "my_collection", data)
```
